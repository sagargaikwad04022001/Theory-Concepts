Profile :- 

In Spring Boot, properties are key-value pairs that configure various aspects of the application. These properties can be specified in different ways, and they play a crucial role in customizing the behavior of your Spring Boot application.
Here are some key types of properties in Spring Boot, with a focus on profiles:
1. Application Properties:
These are the primary properties used to configure your Spring Boot application. They are often defined in application.properties or application.yml files.


spring.profiles.active=test
Profiles allow you to define different sets of configurations for different environments. 
Common profiles include development, test, and production. You can activate a profile using the spring.profiles.active property.


Conditional Properties :-

You can conditionally enable or disable components or configurations based on the presence or value of certain properties. For example:
java
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public class MyFeatureService {
    // Your feature service logic here//
}
These are some of the common ways you can use properties in a Spring Boot application. 
Profiles, in particular, are powerful for managing configurations across different environments. Understanding and leveraging these properties help make your Spring Boot applications flexible and easy to configure for various scenarios.


Difference Between Form Data and x-www-form-urlencoded:-

The terms "form data" and "x-www-form-urlencoded" are often used interchangeably, 
but they refer to slightly different concepts in the context of HTTP requests.
Form Data:
Generic Term: "Form data" is a broad term that refers to any data submitted through an HTML form. 
It can include various types of input, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, etc.
Format: Form data can be submitted in different formats, including application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data. 
The format depends on the enctype attribute specified in the HTML form.

x-www-form-urlencoded
      :-
Specific Content Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded is a specific content type used to encode form data before it is sent in the body of an HTTP request.
Encoding: In this encoding, the form data is represented as a series of key-value pairs separated by "&" characters. Each key and value are URL-encoded. For example, spaces may be represented as "%20," and special characters may be encoded accordingly.
Usage: It is the default encoding type for HTML forms when the enctype attribute is not explicitly specified.
In summary, "form data" is a broad term encompassing any data submitted through an HTML form,
 while "x-www-form-urlencoded" specifically refers to a content type used to encode form data in a specific way for HTTP requests. 
The application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding is widely used for traditional HTML form submissions where data is sent as key-value pairs in the request body.


What is AOP?:---
--------------------------
 Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm aiming to segregate cross-cutting functionalities, such as logging, from business logic in an application 
Spring boot application mainly divided in to three layers:
 Web Layer for exposing the services using RESTFul web services.
 Business layer to handle business logic. 
Data Layer for data persistence logic. 
Each layer is having different responsibility and there are some common aspects which gets apply to all layers. e.g. Logging, Security, Validation, etc. Common aspects are also called as cross-cutting concerns. 
Spring AOP has interceptors which can intercept application and its methods.
 What are AOP Terminologies? 
Aspect : Aspect is a class in which we define Pointcuts and Advices. Advice It’s the behavior that addresses system-wide concerns (logging, security checks, etc…). This behavior is represented by a method to be executed at a JoinPoint. This behavior can be executed Before, After, or Around the JoinPoint according to the Advice type as we will see later. 
Pointcut : A Pointcut is an expression that defines at what JoinPoints a given Advice should be applied.
 JoinPoint : Simply put, a JoinPoint is a point in the execution flow of a method where an Aspect (new behavior) can be plugged in. 
What are Types of advices in aspect J AOP?
 @Before : Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception). 
@AfterReturning : Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally. 
@AfterThrowing : Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception. 
@After : Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return).

Aspect and Advice in Aspect-Oriented Programming Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to modularize system-wide concerns, such as logging, security checks, and error handling, by separating them from the core business logic. A key concept in AOP is the aspect, which is represented by a class where we define pointcuts and advices.
 An advice is the behavior that addresses system-wide concerns and is associated with a specific join point in the program execution flow. It is represented by a method that will be executed at the designated join point. There are different types of advice, including before, after returning, after throwing, after, and around.
 A pointcut is an expression that defines the join points where a particular advice should be applied. It specifies the conditions under which an advice will be triggered. For example, a pointcut may specify that an advice should be executed before a certain method is invoked or after a method throws an exception. 
Join points are specific points in the program execution flow where aspects can be plugged in. They represent the different stages or events in a program's lifecycle where the advice can be applied. Examples of join points include method invocations, method executions, field access, and exception handling: 
@Before: This advice executes before a join point, but it does not have the ability to prevent the execution flow from proceeding to the join point unless an exception is thrown. It is commonly used for tasks such as logging or security checks that need to be performed before a method is executed. 
@AfterReturning: This advice is executed after a join point completes normally, i.e., without throwing an exception. It is often used for tasks like resource cleanup or updating caches. 
@AfterThrowing: This advice is executed if a method exits by throwing an exception. It allows you to handle exceptions and perform appropriate actions, such as logging or error handling. 
@After: This advice is executed regardless of how a join point exits, whether it is through normal return or by throwing an exception. It can be used for tasks like resource cleanup or releasing locks.
 @Around: This is the most powerful advice type. It surrounds a join point, such as a method invocation, and has the ability to prevent the actual method execution. It takes a ProceedingJoinPoint as a parameter, which allows you to execute the target method. By calling the proceed() method on the ProceedingJoinPoint, you can proceed with the original method execution.
 The order in which advice is invoked depends on the advice type. In the case of @Around advice, it is invoked first, followed by @Before advice. This allows the @Around advice to control the method execution and decide whether to proceed or return a response on behalf of the method.
 In summary, AOP introduces the concept of aspects, which are represented by classes containing pointcuts and advices. Advices are the behaviors that address system-wide concerns and are associated with specific join points. Pointcuts define where the advices should be applied. There are different types of advice, including @Before, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, @After, and @Around. Each type of advice provides a different way to intercept and modify the program's execution flow. The @Around advice is the most powerful, as it can prevent method execution and modify the arguments and return values.


Apache Kafka:-

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that is widely used for building
 real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as an
 Apache Software Foundation project, Kafka provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable messaging system.

Key features of Apache Kafka include:-

Distributed System:-- Kafka is designed as a distributed system, allowing it to scale horizontally across multiple servers or nodes. This enables high throughput and fault tolerance.
Publish-Subscribe Model: Kafka follows a publish-subscribe messaging model. Producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive the messages.
Event Streaming:-- Kafka is commonly used for event streaming, where events are continuously produced and consumed in real-time. It allows for the processing of data as it flows through the system.
Durable and Fault-Tolerant:-- Kafka is designed to be highly durable and fault-tolerant. It persists messages on disk and allows for replication of data across multiple brokers to ensure data integrity and availability.
Scalability: Kafka can scale horizontally by adding more broker nodes to the cluster. This makes it suitable for handling large volumes of data and accommodating growing workloads.
Retention and Storage:-- Kafka retains messages for a configurable period, allowing consumers to catch up on missed messages. This makes it suitable for scenarios where historical data is important.
Connectivity and Integration:-- Kafka provides connectors that allow easy integration with various data sources and sinks, enabling seamless data flow between different systems.
Streaming API: Kafka Streams is a Java library for building stream processing applications. It allows developers to process and analyze data in real-time using a high-level API.
Community and Ecosystem:-- Kafka has a vibrant open-source community and a growing ecosystem of tools and extensions that enhance its capabilities. This includes tools for monitoring, management, and integration with other technologies.
Kafka is commonly used in scenarios such as log aggregation, real-time analytics, monitoring, and building event-driven architectures. 
It has become a popular choice for organizations dealing with large-scale data processing and event-driven applications.

Feign Client:--

Feign is a declarative web service client. It makes writing web service clients easier.
 To use Feign create an interface and annotate it. It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations 
and JAX-RS annotations. Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders. 
Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same HttpMessageConverters used by default in Spring Web.
 Spring Cloud integrates Eureka, Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker, as well as Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to provide a load-balanced http client when using Feign.

Micro services resource naming conventions and best practices:--
--------------------------------------------------------------

Service Naming:--

Use meaningful and descriptive names that reflect the service's functionality or purpose.
Stick to lowercase letters and hyphens for service names (e.g., user-service, order-service).
Avoid using underscores, uppercase letters, or special characters in service names.
Endpoint Naming:
Follow RESTful conventions for endpoint naming.
==Use nouns to represent resources and keep the names plural (e.g., /users, /orders).
==Use specific names for resource identifiers, and avoid generic terms (e.g., use /users/{userId} instead of /users/{id}).
Versioning:
==Include versioning information in the API endpoint to support backward compatibility (e.g., /v1/users, /v2/orders).
==Choose a versioning strategy (e.g., path-based versioning, header-based versioning) and stick to it consistently.
Consistent Resource Naming:
==Keep resource names consistent across services to promote a unified and intuitive API.
==Ensure that related resources have similar naming conventions (e.g., /users/{userId}/orders).
Use Plural for Resource Collections:
==Use plural nouns for resource collections to maintain consistency (e.g., /users, /orders).
HTTP Methods:
==Use appropriate HTTP methods for operations on resources (e.g., GET for retrieving, POST for creating, PUT for updating, DELETE for deleting).
==Be consistent in the use of HTTP methods across services.
Error Handling:
==Use standard HTTP status codes for indicating the success or failure of an API request.
==Provide clear and informative error messages in the response body.
Avoid Verbosity:
==Keep resource URIs concise and avoid unnecessary complexity.
==Use sub-resources for related entities rather than embedding everything in a single resource.
Use Hyphens for Readability:
==Separate words in resource names with hyphens for improved readability (e.g., /customer-orders).
Documentation:
==Document your API thoroughly, including resource names, endpoint details, and payload structures.
==Provide examples and usage guidelines to help developers understand how to interact with the API.
Naming Conventions for Databases:
==Align database table and column names with the corresponding microservices and API resources.
==Follow database naming conventions (e.g., use snake_case for column names in SQL databases).
Consistency Across Environments:
==Maintain consistent naming conventions across development, testing, and production environments to avoid confusion.

@ConditionalOnProperty:--
--
  The @ConditionalOnProperty annotation allows you to conditionally register a bean based on the presence or value of a specific configuration property.
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "myapp.feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MyBean conditionalBean() {
        return new MyBean("Conditional Bean");
    }

    // Other beans...
}



Hashing:--
---------------
Purpose: Hashing is primarily used for data integrity verification, digital signatures, and password storage. It transforms input data into a fixed-size hash value, typically a string of characters.
How it Works: Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is designed to be irreversible. A small change in the input results in a substantially different hash value. Hash functions are deterministic, and the same input will always produce the same hash value.
Examples: MD5, SHA-256, SHA-3, and bcrypt are examples of hashing algorithms.

SOLID principles:--
----------------------------

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that aim to make software systems more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym represents the following principles:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle encourages a class to be focused on doing one thing well.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This implies that you can add new functionality without altering existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program's functionality.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests that it is better to have multiple small, specific interfaces rather than a large, monolithic one, and classes should only be required to implement the interfaces that are relevant to them.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define a level of indirection between high-level and low-level modules, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
